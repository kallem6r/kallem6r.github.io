## Who am I?

Hi, my name is Kallem Siofaga Sua and today i'll be explaining a little bit about myself and why I have decided to delve into the world of information technology.

### About me and more 

Allow me to introduce myself, as stated before my name is Kallem Sua, my student number and email is s3879738@student.rmit.edu.au, I was born in Australia with a Samoan heritage with my dad being born in Samoa and mum from New Zealand.
A few of my hobbies including gaming, working out, sports and music. One interesting fact about myself is I have 20,000 hours in Dota 2 as I have played since release and I am a classically trained pianist.

### What interests me in IT

So as a kid I have always being around computers, from playing video games to hosting servers, live streaming sports I have being surrounded by technology all my life. With this in mind I decided after going through my previous roles (with McDonalds and Australian Taxation Office), I decided these we're not the way I wanted to take my career and to take it in an industry that I am actaully interested in.

Studying with RMIT just made sense to me, as a university that is renowned for their IT and engerineering it made sense to start my career off in a university that excels in this area.
I personally expect that with my time at RMIT I will learn the skills necessary to enter in the IT industry, from website creation, cloud management, customer service and quick and efficient problem solving.
