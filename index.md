## Who am I?

Hi, my name is Kallem Siofaga Sua and today i'll be explaining a little bit about myself and why I have decided to delve into the world of information technology.

### About me and more 

Allow me to introduce myself, as stated before my name is Kallem Sua, my student number and email is s3879738@student.rmit.edu.au, I was born in Australia with a Samoan heritage with my dad being born in Samoa and mum from New Zealand.
A few of my hobbies including gaming, working out, sports and music. One interesting fact about myself is I have 20,000 hours in Dota 2 and even travelled overseas to play in tournaments.

### What interests me in IT

So as a kid I have always being around computers, from playing video games to hosting servers, live streaming sports I have being surrounded by technology all my life. With this in mind I decided after going through my previous roles (with McDonalds and Australian Taxation Office), I decided these were not the way I wanted to take my career and to take it in an industry that I am actaully interested in.

Studying with RMIT just made sense to me, as a university that is renowned for their IT and engerineering it made sense to start my career off in a university that excels in this area.
I personally expect that with my time at RMIT I will learn the skills necessary to enter in the IT industry, from website creation, cloud management, customer service and quick and efficient problem solving.

So the role I have allocated as a role that I am interested in is an Applications and Database Analyst which can be found with the link above. 
The thing that has brought my attention to this job is the problem solving aspect that it has and working on the start of new projects.  
What really drives me to believe that this is job that I could see myself doing is the fact that they would have all these different problem solving skills which would be required such as experience using databases and SLQ, the ability to understand and generate scripting through Python and more.

For the role I believe that all these things I am able to learn within this degree and throughout my journey within the IT industry. My current skillset is varied with an abundance of experience using Microsoft365 throughout the entirety of my life using windows as the main OS(Operating System) and already learnt alot of SQL commands and communicating to a databases as it is something that I have already studied at TAFE. The skilsl that I would need to learn which is all avaliable through this current degree is learning and understanding programming and pyhton which is covered within this degree as a different unit and the experience of using a school management systems which is something that I can devlop at home in my spare time while I focusing on hammering down my understanding on the python scripting and using WebAPI's.


### Personality Test
Through the Myers-Briggs personality test, the personality that I had recieved throughh the test was ENFP-T and from what I understand, this personality type's strong areas are its people skills, being able to create an environment of enthusiasm while still caring for the other individuals feelings which can help a group of people working on a project immensely. With this in mind ENFP's do have the tendancy of being easily distracted and lack organisation skills which may create issues within a working environment, as well as  that ENFP's also struggle with following rules and overthink many sitautions which may cause confusion and miscommunication between colleagues.
When forming a team of people, it would be important to not have too many of this personality type as lacking organisational skills and not following rules could cause a lack of workflow produced or even no work being completed as they are also easily distracted.

With this personality test there are things that are influencing the result that in my own opinion does not correlate with someones ability to work within a certain area, some of the questions that were asked that I think do not show someones working ethic are questions that relate to family relationships and all the questions relating to somebodies love perception, with this in mind I believe that the result may not truely correlate with someones working ability and may even give the wrong attention to someones weaknesses when in reality these weaknesses may only exist within their love life/family life and may not even exist at all within their working life.


### Project Idea
As someone who is passionate about music and IT, I wanted to combine the two and because of this, I had the idea of a program that can detect what would be approrpiate music depending on the users mood.

For this program it has a very simple yes or no algorithm, if the program asks the user to answer a question of X or Y and they answer X, then all songs associated with Y will not be listed to the user at the end of the questions. There will be multiple questions and once the program has complied a list of 5-10 songs it will stop asking the questions and provide the user with the music that would be deemed appropriate for the user.

Because of the nature and uniqueness of people and their perception of feelings, the program will have to learn through these tests it puts the users through, if a user is not satisfied at the end the program will take that into account with the answers of the questions. For example if a question ask the user if they are happy or sad and they answer with happy but are not satisfied with the songs provided as it makes them feel sad, then the program will take that into account and could consider moving the song from the happy catogory to the sad with enough feedback.

Because of the learning algorithm that the program will be using, early development and use of the program may classify what is obvious to a person a happy song incorrectly which can either be fixed manually from what I understand to give off a happy or sad emotion through music or it can be sorted as the program is used more by various people.
The basic functions of this program is will start with very broad questions, questions like 'How do you feel' and list basic answers such as 'Happy, Sad, Angry'. Once a basic emotion has being established it can go further to understand this feeling and narrow music to this persons feelings, asking questions such as 'Why are you happy?, When did you start feeling happy? and Did you start your day happy?'. These questions will go further and further till only 5-10 songs are left that could match this path of answers.

The way music will be selected all entirely through the program as music as various concepts that a program could pick up without understanding emotions, things such as the key of the music, what notes are being played and the BPM(Beats per minute) of a song. Through this 'happier' music can generally be associated with music being in a major key, very basic pop-like chord progression and generally higher upbeat and faster music while 'sad' music is generally seen with slower BPM and usually in a minor key. With this generally understand of music and what emotions are coveyed from that information, the program can listen to the music and begin basic sorting of happy/sad music. From there to gain more specifics of what could be a happier or sadder song than another, is more musical ideaology such as tones, instruments used, frequencies which can be used to divided the songs more, till at the end of the tree of questions, there can only be 5-10 songs from the programs database of music.

Once the program has sorted enough music and understood enough feedback to address any outliers it would be able to locate approrpiate music depending on the mood of the person.
